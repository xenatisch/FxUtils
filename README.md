# FxUtils
**General utilities and tools for functional programming in .NET**


The library will grow over time with tools primarily intended 
for use in F#, which are *implemented in F#* to reduce  
reliance on other .NET languages. This is to ensure consistency 
in the adoption of such tools within a functional programming 
paradigm.

Utilities in this library may include native implementations of 
different algorithms, generic SDKs, wrappers, adapters, and so on. 

Feel free to contribute if you want a home for your nifty little 
helper function but don't want to bother with creating an entirely 
separate repository and library.
